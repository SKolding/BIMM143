## Halloween Mini-Project

Here we analyze a candy dataset from the 538 website.

```{r}
candy_file <- "candy-data.csv"
candy = read.csv(candy_file, row.names=1)
head(candy)
```

### Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

```{r}
sum(nrow(candy))
```

There are 85 different types.

### Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

```{r}
sum(candy[,"fruity"])
```

There are 37 fruity types.

# Favorite Candy

### Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s winpercent value?

```{r}
candy["Swedish Fish", "winpercent"]
```

Swedish Fish have a winpercent of 54.9%

### Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat", "winpercent"]
```

Kit Kat win percent = 76.8%.

### Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars", "winpercent"]
```

Tootsie roll win percent = 49.6%.

What is the least liked candy?

```{r}
inds=order(candy[,"winpercent"])
head(candy[inds,])
```

The least liked candy is Nik L Nip.

```{r}
library("skimr")
skim(candy)
```

```{r}
skimr::skim(candy)
```

### Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

The win percent is on a different scale.

### Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy\$chocolate column?

It represents whether the candy is chocolate or not.

### Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(candy)+aes(x=winpercent,)+ geom_histogram(binwidth=2)
```

### Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

They are not symmetrical.

### Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

The center is below 50%

### Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

```{r}
TFchocolate=as.logical(candy[,"chocolate"])
candy[TFchocolate,]$winpercent
```

```{r}
mean(candy[TFchocolate,]$winpercent)
```

```{r}
TFfruity=as.logical(candy[,"fruity"])
mean(candy[TFfruity,]$winpercent)
```

Chocolate candy on average is ranked higher.

### Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

```{r}
t.test(candy[TFchocolate,]$winpercent, candy[TFfruity,]$winpercent)
```

The p-value is small, so it is statistically signficant.

# Ranking

### Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?
```{r}
inds=order(candy[,"winpercent"])
head(candy[inds,])
```
The least liked candy types are Nik L Nip, Boston Baked Beans, Chiclets, Super Bubble, and Jawbusters. 

### Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?
```{r}
inds=rev(order(candy[,"winpercent"]))
head(candy[inds,])
```
The mosted liked Reese's peanut butter cup, Reese's Miniatures, Twix, Kit Kat, and snickers. 

### Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.
```{r}
ggplot(candy)+ aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) + geom_col()
```

### Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent?

```{r}
ggplot(candy)+ 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent),) +
  geom_col() + 
  labs(x="Win Percent", y="Candy")
ggsave('barplot1.png', width=7, height=10)
```

Add some color to our ggplot.
```{r}
my_cols=rep("black", nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] = "chocolate"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] = "brown"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "pink"
```

```{r}
ggplot(candy)+ aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent),) + geom_col(fill=my_cols) + labs(x="Win Percent", y="Candy")

```
### Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?
Sixlet is ranked the worst.

### Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?
Starburst is the best. 

# Pricepercent

If we want to see what is a good candy to buy in terks of minpercent and pricepercent we can plot these two vairables and then see the best candy for the least amount of money.


```{r}
candy$pricepercent
```

### Q19. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?
```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) + geom_text(col=my_cols)
```

To avoid the overplotting of all these labels we can use an add on package ggrepl. 
```{r}
library(ggrepel
        )
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) + geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, max.overlaps =7)

```
Reese's miniatures is best ranked for the least amount.

### Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and of these which is the least popular?
The most expensive is Nik L Nip, Ring Pop, Nestle Smarties, Mr. Good Bar, and Hershey's Milk Chocolate. The least popular is Nik L Nip.

# Correlation

```{r}
library(corrplot)
```
```{r}
cij <- cor(candy)
corrplot(cij)
```

### Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?
Chocolate and fruity 

### Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?
Chocolate and bar or chocolate and winpercent


# PCA
The main function for this is `precom()` and here we know we need to scale our data with `scale=TRUE` argument.

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale=TRUE)
summary(pca)
```
```{r}
plot(pca$x[,1:2])
```

```{r}
library(ggrepel)
my_data <- cbind(candy, pca$x[,1:3])
ggplot(my_data) + 
        aes(x=PC1, y=PC2,label=rownames(my_data)) +
        geom_point(col=my_cols) + geom_text_repel(col=my_cols)  + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title="Halloween Candy PCA Space",
       subtitle="Colored by type: chocolate bar (dark brown), chocolate other (light brown), fruity (red), other (black)")
```

```{r}
par(mar=c(8,4,2,2))
barplot(pca$rotation[,1], las=2, ylab="PC1 Contribution")
```
```{r}
loadings= as.data.frame(pca$rotation)
ggplot(loadings)+ aes(PC1, reorder(rownames(loadings), PC1))+ geom_col()
```


### Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you?
The variables are fruity, pluribus, and hard are in the positive direction. These do make sense since fruity candy tends to have those two characteristics.
